Bravo is highly configurable and extensible. The plugins shipped with Bravo
are listed here, for convenience.

Authenticators
==============

Offline
-------

Offline authentication does no checking against the official minecraft.net
server, so it can be used when minecraft.net is down or the network is
unreachable for any reason. On the downside, it provides no actual security.

Online
------

Online authentication is the traditional authentication with minecraft.net.

Password
--------

Password authentication is an experiemental authentication scheme which
directly authenticates clients against a server without consulting
minecraft.net or any other central authority. However, it is not correctly
implemented in the Notchian client, and will not work with that client.
